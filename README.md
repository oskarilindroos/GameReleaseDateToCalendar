# Introduction
Currently WIP React Native app for easily adding game release dates to your calendar as events. A personal project of mine.

# Technologies to be used

- React Native (Android)
- [react-native-add-calendar-event](https://github.com/vonovak/react-native-add-calendar-event)
- IGDB API (for searching for games and release dates)

# Project goals

- To learn React Native
- To learn TypeScript
- To learn Figma and UI/UX design
- To learn mobile development
- To make an app that is actually useful (at least for me)

# Design

[Current prototype in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/mv5lKRJEosANrBMU9ozkWz/Mobile-APP?node-id=1%3A13&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A13)
