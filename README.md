# Introduction
Currently WIP React Native app for easily adding game release dates to your calendar as events. A personal project of mine.

# Technologies to be used

- React Native Expo (Android)
- Expo Calendar API
- IGDB API (for searching games and release dates)

# Project goals

- To learn React Native
- To learn theming for React
- To learn TypeScript
- To learn Figma and UI/UX design
- To learn mobile development
- To make an app that is actually useful (at least for me)

# Design
